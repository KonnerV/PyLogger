# PyLogger

## Usage

You can use this module to have a log file that you can manage through code easily.
This project was just made out of pure boredom so the code might be extremely bad and slow so please excuse that.

## About

This is a Python Module that is used to log things and use a log file.

## Notes

This project is not close to being finished as there is an abundance of things I need to add or fix.
This Logger module isn't the best out there and it is very simple.
Sorry for the terrible code.

## Setup/Install

This project is a WIP and I will make an installation guide later on.
